## üöÄ AI Agent Projects

### 1. Autonomous IT Incident Responder
- **Problem:** Automate incident monitoring & resolution in IT systems  
- **Solution:** Multi-agent system using **LangChain**, with supervisor‚Äìworker model  
- **Integration:** Connected to mock monitoring APIs, logged incidents, and proposed auto-resolutions  
- **Outcome:** Reduced manual intervention by simulating automated triage & resolution

### 2. LangChain Toolset for API Automation
- **Problem:** Manual API calls slowed workflows  
- **Solution:** Built an agent that dynamically selects & calls APIs based on user prompts  
- **Features:**  
  - Tool usage & dynamic planning  
  - Context injection for chaining calls  
  - Error handling & retry strategies  
- **Outcome:** Seamless **automated data fetch & integration** into pipelines

### 3. RAG Document Search Agent
- **Problem:** Difficulty retrieving accurate information from large documents  
- **Solution:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using **LangChain + FAISS**  
- **Integration:** Document embeddings + conversational retrieval  
- **Outcome:** Accurate multi-turn Q&A over large PDF/text datasets
